## ðŸ“˜ Introduction

This project extends the original **EdgeBank** baseline from the NeurIPS Datasets & Benchmarks paper. In the original work, the authors propose two memorization-based strategies for temporal link prediction:

- **EdgeBank_inf**: A link is predicted if it has *ever* existed in the past.
- **EdgeBank_tw**: A link is predicted if it has existed *within a fixed time window*.

These approaches offer strong baselines for evaluating dynamic graph models, relying solely on link recurrence patterns.

### ðŸ”§ Our Contributions

I introduce two **frequency-based** variants of EdgeBank that take into account *how often* a link has appeared rather than just whether it appeared:

- **`freq_weight`**: Assigns higher confidence to links that appeared more frequently over the entire history.
- **`window_freq_weight`**: Applies frequency weighting *within a moving time window*.

## ðŸ“Š Results

I evaluate the original and proposed EdgeBank variants on 12 diverse dynamic graph datasets. The figure below shows the **mean AUC-ROC** scores per dataset for each method:

As shown above, my proposed `freq_weight*` method outperforms the original `unlim_mem` (EdgeBank_inf)` on every single dataset tested (by a large margin on some datasets). Similarly, `window_freq_weight*` consistently improves upon the `time_window` (EdgeBank_tw) baseline.

To summarize overall performance across all datasets, I also compute the average AUC-ROC (Â± std deviation) per memory strategy:
